>  ### Explain the framework by David Frey 12 Step Copywiring Approach
> 
Welcome back. Now, one very simple copywriting framework that is very simple to understand was written by a marketer named David Fry. If you go to the search bot and you write in and ask it to explain the framework written by David Fry, the 12 step copywriting approach, and then hit enter, you will get an answer. You will see the formula available to you here in search.

And if this isn't really fully understandable, you can then use the search bot feature. You will then see David Fry's 12 step formula. You will also see references that you can click at each point in order to explain to you exactly how to execute it with a particular piece of copy. And it's a good idea to archive both the references as well as the framework to use in your chat bot queries.

Okay? So with that, thanks and I will see you in another video.
