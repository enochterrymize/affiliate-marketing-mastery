>  ### What is the most effective way to write a money back guarantee for a product selling a facebook marketing training course using the problem agitate solve framework.

Welcome back. Now, one of the elements you may want to add to your sales letter is going to be a guarantee of some kind. In some cases, you may give a customer a satisfaction guarantee. You may also give them a 30 day money back guarantee, or at 30 days or some other day point. What's important is the placement of that guarantee and the wording used for the specific guarantee.

Now, assuming that you are going to write in the hypothetical case and you are going to provide some kind of guarantee to your customer, you want to state it in the way that will help you to generate more sales. What we're going to do is we're going to write in a query as to effective language for your guarantee. And so we are going to provide a specific query,

but once again, it's important to note that there is no magic query or a magic prompt for any information that you want. If you don't get the information that you want, you may have to restate what it is that you put into the search bot. What we're now going to do is click enter. Again, this is going to be starter content.

You can restate it any way that you want, but what you'll notice here is that the guarantee is written in context to the entire sales letter using a specific framework. If you're using a different framework, this will look different for your individual case. And once again, we are given a reference here that we can look to in order to determine how to do our money back guarantee.

We can restate the question as if we're going to use a satisfaction guarantee instead of a money back guarantee. So we are going to request that guarantee be rewritten as if it were going to be a satisfaction guarantee instead of a money back guarantee. We're now gonna click enter. Now again, we are using the context already created in the previous areas of our chat.

Now again, we're not gonna be able to come back to this chat, so you are going to want to save the information as you go to a specific document. Okay, with that, thanks and I will see you in another video.
