Welcome back. Now, one of the ways to use the search bot is to reverse the question process. For example, you're going to see the question regarding headline alternatives that we have asked the search bot. What makes the alternatives that have been given to us good headlines. Now, not only do we get the reasoning from the search bot, we also have different articles that we can click on in order to visit so that we can understand the rationale that has been given.

This will give us the ability to sift through the various headlines and to determine which ones will best fit our particular sales letter. What you will also see in many queries, in particular in the chat area, are suggestions given by the search bot. For example, in this particular query, you'll notice that there is a query that you can click on asking for examples of bad headlines for products.

We can click that specific help query in order to get more insight about our headline. And when you see the headline, you can then click on another help query, which will help you to determine what makes these suggestions, poor suggestions. We can also follow up specifically within the context of our specific chat. And again, anytime that you write in what is called a prompt or you write in a natural language,

you're really trying to communicate with the machine as much information as you can give it so they can sift through the alternatives. We're now going to click enter, and again, once we get this information, we can then find out why the headlines are bad. And so basically you'll be able to determine good headlines for your product. You'll also be able to determine what bad headlines are so that you can choose the right ones for your particular situation.

Okay? So with that, thanks and I will see you in another video.
