>  ### using the problem agitate solve framework, write the website copy for an opt-in page where the person who gives their name and email address will get in exchange a pdf detailing 7 mistakes to avoid in starting a facebook page.

Welcome back. We can query the search bot about content for a specific opt-in page. And to do that, we are first going to want to give the search bot a specific framework. We will then want to make our query based on what we are giving away in exchange for the contact details. And so we are going to make a detailed query. We're going to first start with the framework.

We're then going to use an exact language to ask the search bot to give us website copy. We're going to specify what we want the website copy for, and we are going to provide more details about what it is that we want. Now again, what you want to do in many cases is you want to try to give search by as much information as you can.

One of the things you will notice in the bottom right hand corner of the query is that we've only used 226 of the 1000 characters that we are allowed to place in sight of the search query area. Now that we have our query, we're now going to click enter and the search bot is going to give us its rendition of what it is that we are asking.

It's a good idea when you get this information that you go over to the chat area where you're then going to see all of the information that the search bot was able to give you. You'll then want to copy that information and you'll then want to place it inside of your document archive. You can also give the same query to chat G P T. What we're going to do now is we're going to place the query here inside of chat G P T,

and once we have our query, we can then ask the chat G P T version for this same information and you'll see similar information. Now, you don't have to use all of the website copy given to you by chat G P T or by the being search bot, however, you don't have to start with a blank page and you will have information to start with in order to write your opt-in page copy.

Okay? So with that, thanks and I will see you in another video.
