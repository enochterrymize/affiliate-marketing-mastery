Welcome back. Once you have the frameworks in front of you, you can begin to use the search engine as you would a specific chat. And so one of the things that we can do is we can look at the various forms of copywriting that we are going to be doing, and we can input into the chat a question about the appropriate frameworks. For example,

what we can do, we can query the search bot and we can ask for the most appropriate framework for a specific purpose. And so we are going to place a specific query based on the information already into the chat. We're then going to click enter Now, which all notes here is that the search bot has a standard disclaimer at the beginning of its answer.

It then offers additional tips on how to use one of the frameworks and then offers an example of how to use the framework. So one way to use the search bot is to ask for a more specific reference as to which copywriting framework actually works with a specific element. And then in many cases, the search bot will give you an example of how to apply the particular framework to your situation.

So you can approach this for any particular copywriting problem that you are attempting to solve. By determining which framework will work best for your situation. You want to be as specific as you can with this information. Okay? So with that, thanks and I will see you in another video.
