> ### write 5 headline alternatives for a product that sells an information product teaching small online business oweners how to market their business on facebook. product is a video course with 20 videos totally 3 hours, taught by Duncan, a vetran internet marketer. Subjects include Facebook pages, Facebook Groups,Facebook Lives and how to move people from facebook on to an atoreponsder list.

Welcome back. One of the first things you will do if you are writing a specific sales letter is that you will need to write a headline and you can use the search bot in order to help you to sift through different choices of headlines that you feel may be most appropriate for your product. And so we're going to use the chat area of the search bot in order to do it.

Now, what you'll notice is that in the query, we have used 401 of 2000 characters that we have available. Obviously, the more detail that you're going to be able to give the search bot, the better your results will be when they are returned by the search bot. What we are going to do in this particular query is we're going to ask for five headline alternatives.

We're now going to click enter and the search bot will begin the process. Now, in some cases, you may find that the headline alternatives can be used as your sub-headline throughout your sales letter, but once you have your list, you can choose the most appropriate headline or you can use one of these headlines in order to write your own that is more personalized.

Okay, so with that, thanks and I will see you in another video.
