>  ### How to 10 Crafts bullets for a sales letter using the problem agitate solve framework selling a facebook marketing information product to small online business owners. Course created by Thomas Duncan, vetran Trainer for 13 years, course has 20 videos and is 3 hours long. Covers Facebook Pages, Facebook Groups, Facebook Lives, Facebook Profiles and more. Customers will learn how to turn facebook followers into leads to buy their products and services, regardless or market or niche. 

Welcome back. Now keeping the context, one thing you'll want to add in are going to be benefit bullets and we can ask the search bot to give us assistance in crafting benefit bullets. Now again, because we have 2000 characters that we can give the search bot, we want to give it as much information as we possibly can. So what we'll do here is we will ask the search bot to craft bullets.

And as you can see, we've only used 487 characters of the 2000 we are allowed. Now, once again, that is just for the sake of this video. You're going to want to be in the habit of giving the search bot as much information as you possibly can in order to undertake this task. But once again, we are using a specific framework and we're using the context for our conversation.

We are now going to click enter and you'll begin to see that the search MI will attempt to undertake what it is that you have given it to try to solve. Now you have been given a framework for specific bullets. You can use the context to write additional bullets once you understand exactly how they're written as well as their format, and you can use those given to you by the search bot as starter bullets.

Okay, so with that, thanks night. We'll see you in another video.
