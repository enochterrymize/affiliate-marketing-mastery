Welcome back. When you are choosing which AI tool to use, you're going to want to be aware of some of the limitations. One of the limitations of the chat G P T platform is that by default, as of the recording of this video chat, G P T does not cite references. So if we were to look for a specific topic area,

chat, G P T can give us that information. Now, this information does come without citation. We would have to go back and we would ask chat G P T what the references are for this particular information or for information that is like it. And we can go back and ask the engine within the chat for specific citation information. And depending on how you make your query for citation,

you may not get the information that you want. However, when we ask this information of a search bot, we are going to get a different level of information. We will also get specific citation references that may be more up to date than a specific use in chat G P T. And so for the purposes of giving the proper reference, you want to make sure that you're using the right tool for the purposes that you want.

Okay? It's with that, thanks, and I will see you in another video.
