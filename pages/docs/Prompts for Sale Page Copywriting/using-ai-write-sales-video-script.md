> ### Write a sales video script in bullet point format. Each bullet point will go on a seperate slide and be narrated by an expert. The script will sell the Facebook Markerting product to existing small business owners using the copywriting framework from David Frey

Welcome back. It's a good idea to choose a specific framework if you are going to be consistent throughout your entire sales letter. And what you can do to start the process is you can give the search bot the framework that you have decided to use. So we are going to give the search bot the framework, and we are going to request for the best headline that is available.

We're then gonna click enter. Now it's a good idea when you get this information to research the rationale. And again, because you're using the search bot, you're being given links that you can click directly in order to determine if this is the headline you want to use, staying within the context for this specific framework and this specific product. We can then request the search bot to assist us in creating a script for a sales video.

So again, we're going to use imprecise language to communicate the concept that we are looking to create a PowerPoint style sales video. We're going to give a maximum number of words and we're also going to give the search bot as much information as we can. And for the sake of this video, we've only used 634 characters of the 2000 that are available to us.

Typically, you are going to want to use as many of those characters as you can as long as your information is going to be precise and specific. Remember, you are communicating with a machine and an algorithm. The machine then has rules and those rules are generated by specifics. So even though you'll be using in precise language, you want to be specific about what you are asking for.

What we are now going to do is click enter and the search bot will begin writing out our sales video script. When we complete the sales video script, we will obviously copy this sales video script and we will move it onto our document in order to use it. So what you will have is a script based on a specific framework. And so in order to repeat this process,

you're going to want to choose a specific framework. You're then want to give the search bot as much information as you can. For example, we did not give, we did not give the search bot a specific name for the product, however it inserted one any way which we will have to edit. Okay, with that, thanks tonight. We'll see you in another video.
