# Creating Images for your copy

<iframe class="is-fullwidth" height="380" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PnIEGui1ZVc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Welcome back. Now, you may have some specific elements in order to look for the images that will fit the directions from the search bot. You can take those specifics and you can go to an AI art engine in order to draw these specific images. So we're going to take one phrase and we're going to head to an AI art generator inside of graphics creator Canva.

There is a text to image feature. You can use that text to image feature in order to place your specific language to allow Canva to draw the image for you. We're going to place our content in and inside of Canva. We're going to decide on what kind of image we want. We can decide that we want a photo. We are then going to decide what kind of aspect ratio that we want.

We can choose Square Landscape or Portrait. We can then click generate image, and Canva will give us choices based on the image that it creates. We can then add that image to our canvas. We can then manipulate the canvas so that we can use the image in our website copy. Okay? So with that, thanks, and I will see you in another video.
