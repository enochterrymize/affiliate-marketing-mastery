>  ### Write a message to customers who have purchased our course Facebook Marketing Basics for a testimonial that we will use in our sales letter on our sales page with their picture,testimonial and website. The testimonial request and the testimonial should follow all guidelines.

Welcome back. One of the things you are going to want to use in your sales letter is going to be a set of testimonials and you need to request those testimonials from your past customers and or clients. Now, there are definitely rules on what you can and cannot do with testimonials for a specific sales page according to the Federal Trade Commission in the United States.

Now, if you don't live in the United States and you don't have to abide by those laws, it's still a good idea to use the FTC guidelines as a benchmark for what testimonials can and cannot do. You should always follow the laws in your specific country. So what you'll want to do is you'll want to craft a script in order to ask individuals for testimonials for a past purchase.

So we are going to use the search bot in order to craft that message. And so we are going to request that the search bot give us help with crafting the message that we are going to send to the individuals that have purchased a product from us in the past. We are now going to click enter, and you are going to notice some very important elements to the output from the search bot.

You're going to be given the rationale and a place where you can go and read about the rationale. You're going to be given an example of how you can apply these principles in writing a message to request your testimonial, and you're going to be given a disclosure about what the FTC does and does not require. So what you basically have is you have a good framework that you can use in order to request a testimonial,

and you want to make sure that you do the research and understand the laws and guidelines according to testimonial requests. In some cases, you may not want to rely fully on the information from the chatbot as some of the information can either be outdated or it can also be inaccurate. But once again, you do have starter information. Okay? It's with that,

thanks, and I will see you in another video.
