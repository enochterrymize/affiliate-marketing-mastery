>  ### What are the direct reponse copywriting framework?



Welcome back. One of the things that you can do inside of either your search engine or the AI tool that you are using is to determine which frameworks are going to be available to you for your copywriting purposes. And what we're going to do here is we're going to go inside of the Microsoft Bing search engine and we're going to search for direct response copywriting frameworks.

And routinely you are going to find information in search results. You can also use the AI powered engine. Typically, you are going to see a number of frameworks available to you, and it's very common using an AI engine to request that the engine go back and get more for you. But as of the recording of this video, you can see that there are six available to us here on this screen.

What we're going to do is we're going to copy these because we're going to use them for the various forms that we'll be working with, and to determine the accuracy of these frameworks. You're going to notice that you have available to you exact clickable references in order for you to determine the exact accuracy of the information that you have been given. Once you determine this accuracy,

you're going to then want to copy down the frameworks that you're going to be using in the various exercises. Okay? So with that, thanks and I will see you in another video.
