>  ### Can you use a PS with the problem agitate solve framework? what are the reasons, time and place for using a PS at the end of your sales letter ? can you use more than one PS?

Welcome back. In some cases, you may want to add in a PS to the end of your sales letter, and for some formats it's going to be appropriate and others it's not going to be appropriate. This is something that you'll want to query the search bot about. So we are going to query the chat bot about using the PS at the end of a sales letter.

Now, what you'll notice in this particular output from the search bot, yes, not only do we have the rationale, but we also have an example of what it will look like if we add in a ps. And one of the things you'll notice is that it has contextualized this to our hypothetical case. Again, one of the most important elements to this is understanding the rationale of the search bot.

If you find that the logic is inconsistent, you may want to make changes to the output before you begin to use it as your sales editor content. Okay? With that, thanks and I will see you in another video.
