>  ### What Statistics are available that proove that facebook is a good way to market a small business right now

Welcome back When you are using a search bot. One of the things that you can do extremely well is you can look for updated statistics on the product or product category that you are selling. And so what you'll want to do for the sake of your search engine and what you'll want to do for the sake of your sales presentation is you're going to want to find statistics or scientific proof that the method or the product category that you are suggesting actually works.

So what we're going to do right now is we're going to write in a query to the search bot, and we're going to ask for specific information for a hypothetical subject. In this case, the hypothetical subject will be Facebook, and so we're going to look for proof that we can add to our sales presentation from the information that we are gathering. Once we write in our query,

we are then going to click enter. Now, scientific proof is an excellent way of being able to make your case in your sales presentation, and you'll want to use the search bot in order to get information where you can also cite specific sources. Now, there is no particular format in which you must ask the question. What's important is that you keep trying your query until you get the information that you want.

But that is true and provable to other sites that will be good to gather statistical information from, even though it's not directly connected to the search bot is marketing charts.com As of the recording of this video and stta.com, as of the recording of this video, both of these sites are available to you to gather statistics as long as you cite them both as a source.

Okay? It's with that, thanks tonight. We'll see you in another video.
