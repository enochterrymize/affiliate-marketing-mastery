> ### What vendor specific details and personalized details would be needed to use this framework to write a sales letter selling a product on facebook marketing to small online business owners?

Welcome back. Now, as of the recording of this video, the Bing search engine currently does not have a way of going backwards, get your chat history. So for example, if we were to do this query, and you're going to see that the search bot will start to gather information, if we click the chat button, you will be able to keep a contextual conversation with the search bot here in this area.

However, that search conversation will remain as long as the page is going to be open. You will not be able to retain this or to go back in your search history in order to retrieve it. And so as you continue to use the information, you're going to want to save it as you go. In addition to the research that you do from the links given to you by the search bot,

we're now going to continue this conversation here inside of the search bot. We'll ask a specific question about what details will be needed to add to this conversation so that we can write a sales letter In this framework, we are now going to click enter and we'll allow the search bot to respond. And when you ask this question, not only will you be given the details that you'll need to add,

but you'll also be given the rationale as to why you need these details. So if you want to learn about copywriting, what you can do is you can click on these links, you can determine why you're writing in the information that you are giving it. And what you'll want to do with the 2000 characters that you have is you'll want to add in the details that are gonna be specific to your product or service in this area,

understanding that the highest and best use of this chat information is to give you a framework and structure that you can use for your specific details. Okay? So with that, thanks and I will see you in another video.
